Here's a slightly more interactive version:\n\n```python\n# Ask for user's name and print a personalized greeting\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n```\n\nPython is known for its simple and readable syntax. The first example just prints a static message, while the second one:\n1. Asks for user input\n2. Stores it in a variable called 'name'\n3. Uses an f-string to create a personalized message\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of these examples in more detail?"
